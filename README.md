# Algeo01-22015

## Features

1. Solve a system of linear equations using four different techniques:
   - Utilize the Gauss method
   - Apply the Gauss-Jordan method
   - Implement the Inverse method
   - Use the Cramer method
2. Determine the determinant of a given matrix through two distinct methods:
   - Employ the Cofactor expansion technique
   - Utilize the Reduction method
3. Calculate the inverse of a given matrix using two different approaches:
   - Implement the Gauss-Jordan method
   - Utilize the Adjoin method
4. Create an interpolated linear equation that passes through all provided points, and predict the y-value for a given x-value.
5. Conduct multiple linear regression, including formulating the equation and making predictions for the y-value based on the provided x-values.
6. Predict the value of a point using the bicubic spline principle.
7. Adjust the scale of an image.
